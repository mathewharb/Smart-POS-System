2. Download and install composer
3. Open your command prompt editor and navigate to the project's root directory

		               127.0.0.1	smartpos.local
		               ::1	smartpos.local

(where "smartpos.local" is the name of your Virtual Host: it can be given any name)

				DB_CONNECTION=mysql
				DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
				DB_PORT=3306
